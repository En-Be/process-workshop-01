# PROCESS WORKSHOP 01

Process workshops are an hour long session, with each member of a pair spending half an hour attempting to follow best processes to solve a problem, and half an hour observing their partner do the same.
The purpose is to develop and refine our approaches to any coding challenge.

### Get the Middle Character(s)

This was the first process workshop I attended.

#### Requirements


- The program runs in a repl like IRB or in the browser console

- It's fine to use Ruby or JavaScript.

- Your job is to return the middle character of a word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

```ruby
get_middle("test") # => "es"
get_middle("testing") # => "t"
get_middle("middle") # => "dd"
get_middle("A") # => "A"
get_middle("of") # => "of"
```

Observation notes from pair:

30:00 start
27:00 mins planning on paper with setup
18:00 pause imaging how to wrote test coming from terminal
15:00 test failing, felt slightly stuck, tried several diff thing  (‘throwing at it’)
12:00 back to paper after test failing - changed from hello world

My observation:

Hadn't worked in vanilla Ruby for a while and it felt like I'd completely forgotten everything! So I had to fumble around a bit to remember the basic syntax. I thought it would be easier to write a 'hello world' first but this just took too much time and I reverted to the challenge eventually. Although in hindsight, the approach I chose did help me get to a simpler idea for the solution.

I didn't make it to a solution, but next time I know to read the challenge closer. If I had, I might have noticed I could use the acceptance criteria to write the tests.
